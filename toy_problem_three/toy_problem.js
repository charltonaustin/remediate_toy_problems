/*
Create a binary search tree.
Make sure the trees have the following functionality:

Find an element in the tree.

Insert and element into the tree.

Remove an element from a tree.

Return the elements in order from the tree.

Remember a binary search tree is a tree
where each node has up to two children. 
The smaller elements are kept to the left
and the larger elements are kept to the right.
