/*
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
Find the sum of all the primes below 500000.

A prime is defined as a number that is divisible by 
itself and one. 

One way to do this is by trial division. That's where
you check whether a number is prime by dividing it by
every number between 2 and n-1. If it isn't divisible
by any of them it is is prime.

Another way to do this is by Sieve of Eratosthenes.
You first generate a set of all the number between.
You should ask an instructor for an explanation 
when you have solved the problem using the first
method. Then describe the complexity of each 
method.
